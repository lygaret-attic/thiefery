I'm learning "intermediate novice" level clojure right now, which I define as "I'm no longer 
scared of parens, and I think I can write some (bad) code that's not copied wholesale from 
a blog." I'm also learning that I really enjoy being bad at rougelikes, like NetHack, which
I'm terrible at.

As such, I'm working through [Steve Losh's][losh] blog series, ["Caves of Clojure"][caves], in 
which he works through [Trystan Spangler's series][spangler] on writing a roguelike in Java. 

One of the cool things about the way that Steve wrote his series is that he's working the 
problems out on his own, getting better at clojure along the way. Rather than just translating, 
he's synthesizing. What you notice about the way that works, as you read his posts and checkout 
the project's commit history, is that the stops and missteps  were critical to the understanding 
and system building that he does in clojure, and that translating the Java code wouldn't have 
enlightened the way that it looks like it does.


So, i'm going to do the same: with this project I'm going to use Steve's (and Trystan's) blogs
and projects as guideposts; almost homework assignments, and I'm going to build a roguelike in
clojure that feels good to me from the s-expressions up.

We'll see how far along I get.
