# Milestones

* a game shell, which can show a string, change states, and quit.
* a game map, which is larger than the viewport, and can be scrolled around.
* a random dungeon generator, that can make interesting if not particularly sophisticated places to explore.
* a player character that obeys the game physics (no walking through walls, etc).
* extend the player into a generic mob, and basic turn taking AI.
* combat

Once we get to those, here's a bit of a list of things I'd like to try.

* lighting, and line-of-sight, etc. basically, roguelike things.
* I really like the way [brogue](https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/) lighting and colors work.
* Tile based appeals to me more than ASCII, but I should pay my dues.
* I'd like to try real-time (turns happen every x), instead of fixed turn-based.
* I'd like to try multiplayer, but that would require real-time I think.
* I'd like to have a quest system, or even a more sophisticated story. 
* I'd like to have stealing things be a game mechanic.
